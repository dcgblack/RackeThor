# ==== +802.3 Ethernet+
# Should always be followed by an LLC(Logical Link Control) header.
# 
# 	A data packet on an Ethernet link is called an Ethernet packet, which 
# 	transports an Ethernet frame as payload.
# 	
# 	The 802.3 packet header looks usualy looks like:
# 	| Preamble | Dest Addr | Src Addr | Type | Payload  | FCS |
# 	|    8B    |     6B    |    6B    |  2B  | 46-1500B | 4B  |
# 
# 	==== Ether Type - Type
# 	Values of 1500 (0x05DC) and below for this field indicate that the field 
# 	is used +as the size of the payload of the Ethernet Frame+ while values of 
# 	1536 and above indicate that the field is used to represent EtherType.
# 	The interpretation of values 1501â€“1535, inclusive, is undefined.
# 	
# 	Thus the 802.3 would be used instead of Ethernet II only when the type is
# 	lower than 1501.
